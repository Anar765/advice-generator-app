## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned that my API call to `api.adviceslip.com` wasnâ€™t returning fresh data because of browser caching. I fixed it by appending a unique query parameter using `?timestamp=${Date.now()}` to force the browser to fetch a new response each time.
